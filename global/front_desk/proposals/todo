Sample queries for Robin: Caveat Emptor... Most of these queries are not actually
based on Traxx Data. They must be be built into jobinfo. CEx2... Might actually 
have to look at linking the table(s) (left join from hell) to look back ad various
incarnations of the bid/proposal data in traxx, so that queries for things like 
restaraunt/casino will work... Or, might have to allow triangular associations,
as the left join from hell might kill reddwarf or his successor.
