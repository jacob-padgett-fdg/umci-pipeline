The following packages are required on an Unbuntu 10.04 box (and generally required wherever this is run).

- optionally run to update cache:
  sudo apt-get update

Required packages:
  - mysql-server (existing server on another host or locally)
  - ant
  - git-core
  - openjdk-6-jdk
  - mailutils*

* mailutils will install an MTA - stop or remove if not desired (ie, exim) but please be sure to allow
  outbound mail to be sent from this host for notifications to work and set the "notify" variable in
  each script

Install example:
$ sudo apt-get install ant git-core openjdk-6-jdk mailutils

Set JAVA_HOME variable:

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk

This deployment must be run as a user with permission to read the github repository.

There are two steps required to integrate this deploy process with an existing database:
1. sync the database changelogs with the current database:

  $ ./setup_wrapper.sh development

2. apply any subsequent changes (run regularly):

  $ ./deploy_wrapper.sh development

If this system is used to deploy a new system on a new database, simply run the deploy_wrapper with
proper configuration options in build.properties and the correct branch specified, i.e.:

  $ ./deploy_wrapper.sh development


The deploy_wrapper.sh script can then be executed via a crontab entry to automatically deploy or it
can be executed manually as desired.  A sample crontab entry to execute every 15 minutes might be:

*/15 * * * * $path/deploy/deploy_wrapper.sh master > /dev/null 2>&1
