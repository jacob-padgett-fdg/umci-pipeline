Your VPN username is the same as the one you use in the morning.  Your VPN password is assigned and 
is case sEnsItivE.  If you don't know your VPN password, talk to Chris.

<p>

Once you are connected, Start -> Programs -> Accessories -> Communications.  Run Remote Desktop Connection aka Terminal Services.

<p>

If you neeed to print to where you are locally, check the printers box.  This does not always work.  Printing in Terminal Services is supported by your printer!
If you do not see your printer in your session, then your printer does not support Terminal Services and there is not much that can be done except get a different printer.

<p>

Terminal Services is the only way to remotely access the UMC network from off site.  You can no longer access resources directly from your machine.  
If you need to get a file to where you are locally, check the Disk Drives box.  This will allow Terminal Services to see your local disks under My Computer in Terminal Services.

<p>

When you are done, disconnect from Remote Desktop/Terminal Services (Start -> Disconnect), then double click UMC VPN and click the disconnect button.
