I logged in on a new computer and I don't have any printers!  How can I print?

<p>

Open My Computer and in the address bar, type \\servername, servername being whatever your local server is.  \\jupiter, \\fife, \\swedish, etc.

<p>

Then right click on the printer you want to map and click connect...

<p>

It may look like it didn't do anything (it happens pretty quick usually) so go to Start -> Settings -> Printers and you should have a new printer there.

<p>

Right click and "set as default" to whatever printer you want to...shock/surprise... be your default.
