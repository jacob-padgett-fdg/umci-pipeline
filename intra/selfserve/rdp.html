<font size = +1 face =" Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do I connect to Terminal Services?</font>

<p>

<font size = 2 face =" Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are doing this from a non UMC network (home/hotel), first establish a <a href = http://pipeline.umci.com/intra/selfserve/vpn/>VPN</a>.

<p>

To run the Terminal Services client, click on Start -> Programs -> Accessories -> Communication -> Remote Desktop Connection.

<p>

If you have Windows 98/2000, you probably don't have the application installed.  Get it <a href = ftp://ftp.umci.com/wintel/msrdpcli.exe>here</a> and then install it.

<p>

If you are connecting over a VPN, then enter 172.16.116.66.  If you are at a UMC jobsite, then enter 10.0.0.66 in the Computer field.

When you are presented with a logon, use your normal credentials that you normally log on with.  This is Windows In A Box (tm).
