<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href = /intra/selfserve/>Back to Self Serve</a></font>

<p>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">USE THE STYLUS ON THE COPIER.  IT WILL BE MUCH EASIER TO USE.

<p>

Place your documents in the feeder first.  Otherwise you will end up with a blank page at the beginning.

<p>

Switch to scanning mode by pressing (with the stylus remember) the right arrow button on the top right of the screen.

<p>

Pick the destination you want to scan to.

<p>

<b>To scan to file:</b>

<p>

As soon as you pick your destination it will scan your documents and then you can manipulate the rotation, order, etc.  Press Send when complete.

<p>

When it asks for your username, use your username that you use in the morning when you log in.  cbond, jeffb, etc.  Press next.  Use your normal password.  Press OK.  Press OK when it asks about Domain (it's always UMC).  Press Next when it verifies all the info you just entered.

<p>

Depending on the job policies, you may have to fill out some more information.  Is it a submittal, RFI, etc.  Fill out any required fields.  Press Next.

<p>

When you scan to file it will write the PDF in your home drive in pdfoutput just like the PDF printer.

<p>

When you're really done, press the right arrow button in the top right corner to switch it back to copier mode.
