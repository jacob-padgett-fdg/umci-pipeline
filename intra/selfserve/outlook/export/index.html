<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this list, you can select which folders you want to export.</font>

<p>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notice the <font color = #ff0000><b>red</b></font> box.  If you have a 
job folder with sub folders and need to archive the entire thing, select 
the top job folder, select "Include subfolders", and it will export that 
folder plus everything inside.  You can also select "Outlook Today" 
(top of the folder list) along with "Include subfolders" and ALL your 
email will be exported.  This is an easy way for you to manually backup your mailbox.</font>

<p>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Caution!  This may take a while depending on how much email you have.</font>

<tr>
  <td>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this step, you can specify what you want to call the folder when you 
re-open it.  A job name would be a good idea here too.</font>

<p>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please don't put a password on the file.  If someone else in the future needs to reference 
your old email, then they have to track you down and you may not remember the password...  It gets ugly.</font>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you click OK on the last step, Outlook will read the selected folders and download the email
to the file location you specified.  This may take some time depending on how much email/attachments you're exporting.</font>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ok, now that you've made the export file, how do you get back into it to look at the email exported?</font>

<p>

<table width = 720 border = 1 cellpadding = 8 cellspacing = 0>
<tr>
  <td><font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Outlook, go to the File menu, Open, Personal Folders File (.pst)</font></td>

  <td>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you find the file and open it, it will attach itself into the Outlook tree like this.</font>

<p>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this case, I kept the name "Personal Folders" but if I had named it properly according 
to the job I was exporting, that name would have shown up.</font>

<p>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you have opened the PST file, you can also add to it by dragging and dropping items from your 
Mailbox down into a folder in the Personal Folders section.  Like if you wanted to add your Sent Items.</font>

<p>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that the files have been exported, I can delete the folders in my Mailbox to clear up 
server space and reduce the clutter in my Inbox.</font>

<p>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Personal Folder will remain opened/connected until you close it.  To close it, just right 
click on the Personal Folder folder, then "Close Personal Folder".</font>
