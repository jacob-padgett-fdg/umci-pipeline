First off, Jeff and I love <a href = http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/>RedDwarf.</a>

<p>

Secondly, every shop has a naming convention.

<p>

At home I have astronomical naming: Saturn, Venus, Crater, Hubble, Haley, Meteor, Mars...  <br>
Jeff has electical (he used to work at Fluke): LED, Capacitor, Diode...  

<p>

It's up to the admin(s) to pick a convention.  Sometimes it's something really boring like Server01, SVR01-13, boring1, boring2.  Since we both like the Red Dwarf series we went with that.

<p>

On to the boxen.

  Jupiter Mining Corp is the company that hired the cast of the Red Dwarf series.  It's also a big planet.  Jupiter the computer however is the main filserver and is also very bi.  Started originally with 200Gb of disk space, now is 2Tb!  Dual Xeon 3GHz processors (4 virtual CPUs).  Hefty.

  What happens if Jupiter goes down due to hardware failure?  We have a mirror box called Io.  Io is almost exactly the same hardware as Jupiter so in a pinch it can act as Jupiter.  Everytime you save/delete/rename/do anything to a file on Jupiter, it alos happens on Io.  While not astronomically accurate (Io is a moon of Jupiter and quite different physically), it's also a play on words as in computer land I/O is Input/Output.

  Reddwarf used to be the web server.  He was big and red.  Used to be the Vision accounting server and it used to be black.  He had 6 Pentium Pro 200MHz processors!  In this day of 2GHz machines, it's amazing what we squeezed out of 200Mhz...

  Peterson's dumb as an ox.  He was our old Exchange (mail) server.  He was too oxenish though so he got replaced by Ackerman.
