<title>How to scan to PDF on a Konica copier</title>

<body bgcolor = #ffffff>

<table border = 0 width = 720>
<tr>
<td>
<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href = /intra/selfserve/>Back to Self Serve</a></font>

<p>

<font size = 2 face = "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Go to the copier that you will aquire your image from.  You need to switch to scan mode, enter your employee number, scan your documents, then press the auto reset button.

<p>

Ok, so now the paper is in digital form somewhere, but you still have to retrieve it.  So back on your machine, run Imaging.  Start -> Programs -> Accessories -> Imaging.

<p>

Then File -> Aquire, or press the Scan New button (top left on the button bar).  This will connect to the copier programmed in to Imaging.  It will list all the documents in your mailbox.  Pick one and hit "Reading".  This will download the image to your machine removing it from the copier.  

<p>

Then File -> Print and pick the PDF printer.  If the pages scanned are anything <b>other</b> than letter size in portrait mode, you need to tell Imaging the size/orientation.  Go to the Image Options tab and select orientation, then go into Advanced and pick the size.  Then print and you'll have a PDF in your home directory.
