Hey!  Did you know you can make PDFs out of anything you can normally print to paper?!  It's true!

<p>

To check if you already have the printer installed, go to Start -> Settings -> Printers.  Look for 
"PDF on Jupiter" (or your local server if you're offsite).  

<p>

Is it there?  Cool.  Anything you print to this printer will become a PDF and it will be located 
in your home drive (H: or "your username on your server") in a folder named pdfoutput.  Unfortunately Windows doesn't give us anything 
to work with really so the file name will be somewhat randomish.  It's a sequence number and a random number.  
But you were going to rename it anyway, right?

<p>


If you don't have the PDF printer installed, it's very easy to add.  You can either call Chris and 
he'll walk you through it or you can add it yourself.  In the Printers window (you left that open right?) 
run the Add Printer wizard.  The path is \\jupiter\pdf (or \\yourserver\pdf for offsite) and the printer driver you want to use is 
the HP Color LaserJet 8500 PS.  That's it!

<p>

Once you have printed whatever it is that you need a PDF of, you can attach that PDF to an email 
or file it wherever you file your documents.
