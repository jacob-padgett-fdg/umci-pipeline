<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>All UMC technology hardware and
software is purchased and installed by our IT staff.  As is laid out
in our employee handbook, it is against UMC’s policy for anyone to
download or install software of any kind (even if you think you have
a valid software user agreement); or, add or delete any hardware
components from UMC equipment.  That includes, but is not limited to:
instant messaging services, Internet music services, etc. See your
UMC Employee Handbook for additional important rules and guidelines.</FONT></P>

first point of contact is Chris Bondelid.  Jeff, and myself will assist with the solution only as
required.  Please use the following methods to inform Chris that you
need assistance:</FONT></P>

	questions.  Be sure to completely fill in all requested information.</FONT></FONT></P>
